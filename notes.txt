Ok, this is just a notes file for ideas before i start writing this game.

----- Concept -----
The concept should be a chunithum type game, but you control a cursor with your mouse

----- Note types -----
Normal: Notes you click
Normal Long: Notes you click, hold, and release for.
Gold: Normal notes, but clicking is not required
Gold Long: Just keep your mouse over them
Swipe: Swipe notes can be in 4 directions, up, left, right, down, for these you swipe your mouse in the direction of the arrow on the note
Scroll: Scroll notes can be in 2 directions, up and down, for these you use your scroll wheel to hit them
